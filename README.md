## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a scheduler that allows the user to plan out the day. The app dynamically renders each row according to the time of the day. If the time has passed, it grays out the row, if the time is on the hour, it highlights it in read, and if the event has  yet to happen in the day, it highlights the row green. 
## Usage
The user is able to plan out the daily tasks, store them and re-use the calander every day with updated day and time. 
## Installation
